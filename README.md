# MacToWindowsLinks

This program is designed to convert Mac `smb://my-folder` or `//my-folder` links to Windows `\\my-folder` network links. It monitors your clipboard for any changes and automatically convert any links found that match the following regex `^(smb://.*|//[a-zA-Z].*)`, modify to suit your usecase.
